### Hi ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Golang developer.  
I used to love Java, but the only thing I miss from it is Spring Data. Go feels amazing and I've been happy writing Go code since 2020.  
#### Key Go advantages over Java:
1. The compilation is blazingly fast. I don't have to waste time waiting for tests to start.
2. Java is the land of patterns and architectures. Everything is abstracted from you whereas Go's mindset embraces simplicity and "nakedness", making you understand your tools better.
3. With the goal of simplicity, Go is dumb-easy to write!
4. Thanks to Go being compiled into an executable binary, it consumes little and is much cheaper to run in the cloud!
5. Go is closer to C than Java, allowing you to write low-level tools.
7. Built-in packaging (Go doesn't need to build packages!), built-in concurrency (look into channels), built-in testing and so many right decisions (modular folders, first-class functions, implicit interfaces and so on and so on)
